# ðŸš€ NumPy Learning Journey  

This repository contains my learning journey with **NumPy**, one of the most powerful Python libraries for numerical computing.  
I practiced concepts from basics to intermediate level and implemented them through hands-on examples. 

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside
- âœ… NumPy basics: arrays, indexing, slicing  
- âœ… Mathematical operations & broadcasting  
- âœ… Array manipulation (reshape, stack, split)  
- âœ… Statistical functions & random module  
- âœ… Vectorization for faster computations
